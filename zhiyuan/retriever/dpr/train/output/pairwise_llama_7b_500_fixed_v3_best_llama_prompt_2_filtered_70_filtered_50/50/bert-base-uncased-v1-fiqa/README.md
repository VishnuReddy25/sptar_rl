- source_sentence: Is foreign stock considered more risky than local stock and why?
  sentences:
  - ' "In addition to @MD-tech''s answer: I''d distinguish between stock of a foreign
    company traded in local currency at a local exchange from the same stock traded
    in the foreign currency at a foreign exchange (and maybe with a foreign bank holding
    your accounts). The latter option will typically have higher variation because
    of exchange rate, and (usually) higher risks associated with possibility of recovery,
    (double) taxation and the possible legal difficulties @MD-tech mentions. Trading
    the foreign stock at a local exchange may mean that the transaction volume is
    far lower than at their ""home"" exchange. Holding stock of companies working
    in foreign markets OTOH can be seen as diversification and may lower your risk.
    If you only invest in the local market, your investments may be subject to the
    same economic fluctuations that your wage/employment/pension situation is subject
    to - it may be good to try de-correlating this a bit. Of course, depending on
    political circumstances in your home country, foreign investments may be less
    risky (though I''d suspect these home countries also come with a high risk of
    seizing foreign investments...)"'
  - ' If you know that your tax situation is not easily handled by the standard withholding
    table then you can use that line to ask for additional funds be withheld. You
    could also ask for less money to be withheld.   Why would somebody do this? They
    had a small side business that made them extra income, and wanted to withhold
    extra money from their full time job to cover the extra income. They might have
    been awarded a big bonus and it caused too much in taxes to be withheld so they
    wanted to not have as much taxes from their regular pay check. Given the fact
    that you are young, in your first real job, and almost the entire tax year ahead
    of you, it is likely that the standard tax tables will be close enough. So leave
    the line blank or put zero.'
  - ' Some context - Ben Wu, aka Merlini, is one of the most well known figures in
    the Dota 2 community. He was one of the top professional players in Dota 2''s
    predecessor, DotA, and is now a highly respected commentator and instructor. His
    success is definitely something that would be very difficult for most people to
    replicate.'

    I'm paying the mortgage Can I quit my house to my ex-husband and he pay the mortgage
    I'm in California If he's not paying the mortgage can he come after me for the

  sentences:
  - ' In 1929 the Dow Jones Industrial Average peaked at roughly 390 just prior to
    the Great Depression. It did not return to that level again until 25 years later
    in 1954. 25 years is a long time to go without any returns, especially if you
    are a retiree. There is no easy answer with investing. Trying to time the tops
    and bottoms is widely regarded as a foolhardy endeavor, but whenever you invest
    you expose yourself to the possibility of this scenario. The only thing I highly
    recommend is not to base your decision on the historical returns from 1975 to
    2000 that the other answers have presented. These returns can be explained by
    policy changes that many are coming to understand are unsustainable. The growth
    of our debt, income inequality, and monetary manipulation by central banks are
    all reasons to be skeptical of future returns.'
  - ' Unfortunately, there isn''t much you can do.  If your name was on the mortgage,
    you owe the money, regardless of who kept the house. They can (and likely will)
    come after you for the money as well.  A bit late in your case, but that''s why
    when people divorce, refinancing the house into one person''s name (and the other
    quit-claiming their interest) is usually part of the settlement. ETA:  As others
    have mentioned, since you are in California, it appears that they cannot come
    after you for the difference.'
  - ' Additionally, it used to be the case that savings accounts would have a noticeably
    higher interest than checking accounts (if the checking account paid any at all).  So
    you would attempt to maximize your cash working for you by putting as much as
    you could into the savings account and then only transferring out what you needed
    to cover bills, etc into the checking account.'
- source_sentence: What is the purpose of the FDA
  sentences:
  - ' Can he legally break your lease if he sells the place?  If not I would just
    keep renting. It doesn''t sound like you love the house and you plan on moving
    or would prefer a different type of place long term. Unless you yourself plan
    on getting involved in being a renting it out to others in the future - just rent
    and move on at some point. If he can break your lease upon sale of the property
    then I''d be casually keeping an eye out for another place to rent if that happens.'
  - ' "You file taxes as usual. W2 is a form given to you, you don''t need to fill
    it. Similarly, 1099. Both report moneys paid to you by your employers. W2 is for
    actual employer (the one where you''re on the payroll), 1099 is for contractors
    (where you invoice the entity you provide services to and get paid per contract).
    You need to look at form 1040 and its instructions as to how exactly to fill it.
    That would be the annual tax return. It has various schedules (A, B, C, D, E,
    F, H, etc) which you should familiarize yourself with, and various additional
    forms that you attach to it. If you''re self employed, you''re expected  to make
    quarterly estimate payments, but if you''re a salaried employee you can instruct
    your employer to withhold the amounts you expect to owe for taxes from your salary,
    instead. If you''re using a tax preparation software (like TurboTax or TaxAct),
    it will ""interview"" you to get all the needed information and provide you with
    the forms filled accordingly. Alternatively you can pay someone to prepare the
    tax return for you."'
  - ' "So this has been true... Forever. I mean can we agree that there is enough
    corruption to be the dividing line between the 1% and the rest of society? The
    system is built to protect the rich and grow the wealth of the already wealthy.
    The middle and lower class are being farmed like animals while food quality is
    disgusting due to FDA ""failure,"" medicine is becoming a periodical subscription
    because modern disease is trending towards ""lifelong"" sicknesses, health insurance

- source_sentence: Ideal investments for a recent college grad with very high risk
    tolerance?
  sentences:
  - ' "Highly Compensated Employee Rules Aim to Make 401k''s Fair would be the piece
    that I suspect you are missing here.  I remember hearing of this rule when I worked
    in the US and can understand why it exists.  A key quote from the article: You
    wouldn''t think the prospect of getting money from an employer   would be nerve-wracking.
    But those jittery co-workers are highly   compensated employees (HCEs) concerned
    that they will receive a refund   of excess 401k contributions because their plan
    failed its   discrimination test. A refund means they will owe more income tax
    for   the current tax year. Geersk (a pseudonym), who is also an HCE, is in   information
    services and manages the computers that process his firm''s   401k plan. 401(k)
    - Wikipedia reference on this:  To help ensure that companies extend their 401(k)
    plans to low-paid   employees, an IRS rule limits the maximum deferral by the
    company''s   ""highly compensated"" employees, based on the average deferral by
    the   company''s non-highly compensated employees. If the less compensated   employees
    are allowed to save more for retirement, then the executives   are allowed to
    save more for retirement. This provision is enforced   via ""non-discrimination
    testing"". Non-discrimination testing takes the   deferral rates of ""highly compensated
    employees"" (HCEs) and compares   them to non-highly compensated employees (NHCEs).
    An HCE in 2008 is   defined as an employee with compensation of greater than $100,000
    in   2007 or an employee that owned more than 5% of the business at any   time
    during the year or the preceding year.[13] In addition to the   $100,000 limit
    for determining HCEs, employers can elect to limit the   top-paid group of employees
    to the top 20% of employees ranked by   compensation.[13] That is for plans whose
    first day of the plan year   is in calendar year 2007, we look to each employee''s
    prior year gross   compensation (also known as ''Medicare wages'') and those who
    earned   more than $100,000 are HCEs. Most testing done now in 2009 will be for   the
    2008 plan year and compare employees'' 2007 plan year gross   compensation to
    the $100,000 threshold for 2007 to determine who is   HCE and who is a NHCE. The
    threshold was $110,000 in 2010 and it did   not change for 2011. The average deferral
    percentage (ADP) of all HCEs, as a group, can be   no more than 2 percentage points
    greater (or 125% of, whichever is   more) than the NHCEs, as a group. This is
    known as the ADP test. When   a plan fails the ADP test, it essentially has two
    options to come into   compliance. It can have a return of excess done to the
    HCEs to bring   their ADP to a lower, passing, level. Or it can process a ""qualified   non-elective
    contribution"" (QNEC) to some or all of the NHCEs to raise   their ADP to a passing
    level. The return of excess requires the plan   to send a taxable distribution
    to the HCEs (or reclassify regular   contributions as catch-up contributions subject
    to the annual catch-up   limit for those HCEs over 50) by March 15 of the year
    following the   failed test. A QNEC must be an immediately vested contribution.
    The annual contribution percentage (ACP) test is similarly performed   but also
    includes employer matching and employee after-tax   contributions. ACPs do not
    use the simple 2% threshold, and include   other provisions which can allow the
    plan to ""shift"" excess passing   rates from the ADP over to the ACP. A failed
    ACP test is likewise   addressed through return of excess, or a QNEC or qualified
    match   (QMAC). There are a number of ""safe harbor"" provisions that can allow
    a   company to be exempted from the ADP test. This includes making a ""safe   harbor""
    employer contribution to employees'' accounts. Safe harbor   contributions can
    take the form of a match (generally totaling 4% of   pay) or a non-elective profit
    sharing (totaling 3% of pay). Safe   harbor 401(k) contributions must be 100%
    vested at all times with   immediate eligibility for employees. There are other
    administrative   requirements within the safe harbor, such as requiring the employer
    to   notify all eligible employees of the opportunity to participate in the   plan,
    and restricting the employer from suspending participants for   any reason other
    than due to a hardship withdrawal."'
  - ' Sorry to be boring but you have the luxury of time and do not need high-risk
    investments. Just put the surplus cash into a diversified blue-chip fund, sit
    back, and enjoy it supporting you in 50 years time. Your post makes me think you''re
    implicitly assuming that since you have a very high risk tolerance you ought to
    be able to earn spectacular returns. Unfortunately the risks involved are extremely
    difficult to quantify and there''s no guarantee they''re fairly discounted. Most
    people would intuitively realise betting on 100-1 horses is a losing proposition
    but not realise just how bad it is. In reality far fewer than one in a thousand
    100-1 shots actually win.'
  - ' "Assume they do not overwithhold. You pay in $500/mo, and every time it hits
    $3000, they pay the tax. Engineers call this a sawtooth function, it looks like
    this.  The average balance is not $3000, but close to $1500. The very simple math
    is $1500 * rate * years.  It looks like your equation except it''s not 58, it''s
    just the years. And the question is whether you can make more than $850 on $1500
    average before you sell. I wouldn''t be so quick to plug in 29 years, as the average
    home ownership is 7 years, and depending, who knows if a refinance is in your
    future?  The bottom line - How long would it take you to get a 57% return (2350/1500)?
    Ironically, the most responsible (and risk averse) person would say ""decades.
    Banks offer less than 1%."" even an 8% market return, while not guaranteed, is
    close to 7 years. But, if you carry 18% credit card debt, you can pay it down
    a bit each month and let it float back up every 6 months. Less than 4 years to
    break even."'

  sentences:

    your   rights under the ESPP. You have bought   some stock. So far so good. When
    you sell the stock, the discount   that you received when you bought the   stock

  - ' Rule of thumb is always BUY, NEVER lease, unless you plan to use it for a business

    deal on a 1-3 year old used car.'
  - ' "Other individuals answered how owning an REIT compares to an individual real
    estate investment, but did not answer your second question as readily, ""are REITs
    a good option to generate passive income for awhile?"". The ""awhile"" part is
    quite important in answering this question. If your intentions are to invest for
    a relatively short time period (say, 7 years or less), it may be especially advantageous
    to invest in a REIT. The foremost advantage comes from significantly lower transaction
    fees (stock/ETF trades are practically/potentially free today) compared to purchasing
    real estate, which involves inspection+titling fees/taxes/broker fees, which in
    a round-trip transaction (purchase and sale) would come to ~10%. The secondary
    advantage to owning a REIT is they are much more liquid than a property. If you
    wanted to sell your investment at a given point in time, you can easily log into
    your brokerage and execute your transaction, while liquidating an investment property
    will take time on market/potentially tossing tenants/fixing up place, etc. On
    the other hand, illiquid investments have generally yielded higher historical
    returns according to past research."'

  | <code>How exactly do dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) work?</code>                                  | <code> I think Wikipedia offers a very good explanation: A dividend reinvestment program or dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) is an equity investment option offered directly from the underlying company. The investor does not receive quarterly dividends directly as cash; instead, the investor's dividends are directly reinvested in the underlying equity. The investor must still pay tax annually on his or her dividend income, whether it is received or reinvested. This allows the investment return from dividends to be immediately invested for the purpose of price appreciation and compounding, without incurring brokerage fees or waiting to accumulate enough cash for a full share of stock. So essentially, a dividend reinvestment plan is offered by companies directly, allowing investors to bypass brokerages, and immediately re-invests dividends rather than paying them out in cash. Investopedia also gives a straighforward definition: A plan offered by a corporation that allows investors to reinvest ...</code> | <code>1</code> |
  | <code>Thinking of doing an MBA: Is an $80K top MBA school better than a $24K online MBA school?</code> | <code> "I met two MBA graduates from Harvard - both made VPs at large Canadian companies (i.e. $1B or greater annual revenue) after working 2-5 years as management consultants post-graduation - one is now a divisional president making over $500K in salary along. When I asked one of them (one that is not yet making $500K in salary) about the Harvard MBA difference, he said the brand-name and the network probably set it apart from others, since most MBA schools now uses the same material as Harvard's.   I tend to agree with his thoughts - I never did felt the caliber of my professor had much to do with my ability to apply what I learn to practical use.  In my own MBA education, the professor did more facilitation than ""teaching"".  Apparently that is the norm, as MBA is less about being fed information than it is about demonstrating the ability to analyze and present information.  Back to M.Attia's question, I would go with the highest ranked MBA education I could afford (both financially and...</code> | <code>1</code> |
