- source_sentence: Can I change my loan term from 60 to 36 months?
  sentences:
  - ' Some places banks/Credit Unions will allow you to refinance a auto loan. My
    credit Union only does this if the original loan was with another lender. They
    will send the money to the old lender, then give you a loan under the new terms.
    They are trying to get your business, not necessarily looking for a way make less
    money for themselves.  You will have to see how much you will save. Which will
    be based on the delta of the length of the loan or the change in interest rate,
    or both. My Credit Union has a calculator to show you the numbers based on keeping
    the size of the payments the same, or keeping the number of payments the same.  Make
    sure you understand any limitations regarding the refinance based on the age of
    the car, and if you are underwater.'
  - ' Yes, if their record keeping is faulty or failed. It is best to keep all records
    of repayment.  Incomplete records such as signing for a loan yet no repayment
    receipt can be at least a headache and at most expensive. The most important document
    is a record of 0 balance then there is nothing that the courts will allow creditors
    to collect if their records are faulty.'
  - ' "I think the question can be answered by realizing that whoever is buying the
    stock is buying it from someone who can do the same mathematics. Ask your son
    to imagine that everyone planned to buy the stock exactly one week before Christmas.  Would
    the price still be cheap?  The problem is that if everyone knows the price will
    go up, the people who own it already won''t want to sell.  If you''re buying something
    from someone who doesn''t really want to sell it, you have to pay more to get
    it.  So the price goes up a week before Christmas, rather than after Christmas.
    But of course everyone else can figure this out too.  So they are going to buy
    2 weeks before, but that means the price goes up 2 weeks before rather than 1
    week.  You play this game over and over, and eventually the expected increased
    Christmas sales are ""priced in"".  But of course there is a chance people are
    setting the price based on a mistaken belief. So the winner isn''t the person
    who buys just before the others, but rather the one who can more accurately predict
    what the sales will be (this is why insider trading is so tempting even if it''s
    illegal).  The price you see right now represents what people anticipate the price
    will be in the future, what dividends are expected in the future, how much risk
    people think there is, and how that compares with other available investments."'
- source_sentence: Entering the stock market in a poor economy
  sentences:
  - ' Insurance isn''t a product designed to protect against financial loss. The product
    is designed to allow people to pay a small fee (the premium) for peace of mind.
    This allows the insured to feel as if their purchase was worthy (they see the
    potential of loss as a concern and the premiums small enough to allow them to
    not worry about having a loss). Insurance companies will then seek out insurable
    risks where the perceived losses far out weight the actual losses (risk assessment).
    So, you answer is that your friends are paying for peace of mind.'
  - ' Well, you probably already know this, but no-one can guarantee you results...in
    any economic climate.  Even traditionally low risk investments now seem higher
    risk to people when the economic forecasts are grim.  That being said, 0.5% is
    pretty low.  So, where does that leave you? Why not start with a risk tolerance
    analysis for yourself.  There''s a bunch on them on the internet if you google
    it.  Here''s one:  Rutgers Financial Risk Tolerance Quiz Based on the result you
    get back, and whether you agree with it or not, this may give you a starting point
    for determining if entering the stock market is right for you.  I''m guessing
    you can get better than 0.5% return over 10 years pretty easily though.'
  - ' I think you''re dancing with the line here, this question is hard to back up
    without opinions and could really be three different questions. I''m going to
    push aside the part about quality and reliability, that could be an emotional
    subject. So from a price standpoint, there''s virtually no disagrement that it
    makes financial sense to buy a used car instead of a new car. The majority of
    new cars lose the majority of  their resale value within the first year or two.
    If you purchase said car after someone else has used it for the first two years,
    you just avoided all of that depreciation yourself, and you''re still going to
    be purchasing a perfectly reliable car as long as you are diligent in the buying
    process.'
- source_sentence: How do you tell your story to get an actuary position
  sentences:
  - ' "fennec has a very good answer but i feel it provides too much information.
    So i''ll just try to explain what that sentence says. Put option is the right
    to sell a stock. ""16 puts on Cisco at 71 cents"", means John comes to Jim and
    says, i''ll give you 71 cent now, if you allow me to sell one share of Cisco to
    you at $16 at some point in the future ( on expiration date).  NYT quote says
    1000 puts that means 1000 contracts - he bought a right to sell 100,000 shares
    of Cisco on some day at $16/share. Call option - same idea: right to buy a stock."'
  - ' Yes, it is safe, we have been doing it for years. We prefer our tenants to make
    their rent payments in this manner. In fact, we prefer that they set up an automatic
    payment for the rent, either through their online banking or through their bank
    directly. Apart from getting your rent on time, this method also has the added
    benefit of both parties having their own records of rent payments through their
    bank statements, in case there is a dispute about the rent sometime down the track.
    Having a separate bank account just for the rent does make sense as well, it makes
    it easier for you to check if rent has come in, it makes it easier if you need
    to compare your statement without having to highlight all the rent payments amongst
    all other payments (you might not want to show your other incomes and spending
    habits to others), and you can withdraw the rents to your other account (which
    might offer higher interest) after it has come in, leaving a small balance most
    of the time in your rent account.'
  - ' "Embrace the role and learn how to tell your story. Find an interesting way
    to tie your past experience, education, and goals directly to the role you want.   If
    you can show that you are glowing interest with the background and skills you
    have then you will have no problem finding a quant-type role. You need to make
    it sound like everything you have done up to this point was to prepare you for
    this type of role (e.g. ""I accepted a SE role so that I could take steps toward
    learning how to implement the types of Actuarial models I learned at my previous
    gig on a larger scale, how to integrate those models with others, etc.."").  Source:
    Was in similar position and achieved similar goal."'
- source_sentence: Tenant wants to pay rent with EFT
  sentences:
  - ' The cost of an extra 30 days is $1459.80'
  - ' "The biggest disadvantage to you is that your tenant now knows your bank information,
    which means he can easily identify your source of money in the event he wins a
    lawsuit and wins a judgement.  He will be able to have a court marshall freeze
    your account. However, if you deposit your tenant''s check into your account as
    opposed to an EFT, then your tenant can basically still obtain your bank account
    information and freeze your account, it would just take him a bit longer to get
    that information. I am definitely anti-landlord in these situations because I''ve
    had to deal with so many bad ones here in NYC, but as a landlord, the best thing
    you can do is to create a ""buffer"" account for you to deposit tenant rent money
    into, then transfer the money from the buffer account to your regular account.  This
    would prevent the tenant from knowing your personal bank information and greatly
    delay the tenant receiving his judgement from an assumed court win against you.
    My source:  I had to take my landlord to court, and after obtaining a judgement,
    I got a court marshall to begin the process of closing access to her account (she
    couldn''t access the money in that account).  The process resulted in her sending
    me a check (assuming from her other account) for the judgement since her account
    was frozen and she couldn''t access any of her money."'
  - ' I can''t immediately think of a reason to keep your paycheck and spending account
    separate, unless it be because you want to keep your savings in a money market
    or savings account and you deposit your paycheck into a checking account. However,
    I do have one reason from my experience to keep the bulk of your savings away
    from accounts that you transfer stuff out of.  I used to keep all my cash savings
    in an account from which I transferred money into my brokerage account (my paycheck
    was also deposited there).  A couple of years back a state that I haven''t lived
    in since I was a child took $40,000 out of my account.  The broker mistakenly
    told the state I lived there and the state made some mistakes about how much tax
    I would owe.  Without either one telling me, the state helped themselves to my
    checking account to cover the bill.  When I called, both acknowledged that they
    were wrong, but it still took a long time (many months) and lots of letters and
    threats (I was close to paying a lawyer) before they returned my money.  It was
    worse because this was my savings for a down payment on a home and having it taken
    and not returned affected my ability to buy the house I wanted. If I hadn''t had
    my money in that account, they would have tried to garnish my wages, and would
    have immediately stopped their attempt once they found out they were in the wrong.
    Now I keep cash savings in an account that I never pay taxes out of and do not
    use to transfer money directly to any broker or anyone who might give my account
    number to an inept government.'
- source_sentence: Tenant wants to pay rent with EFT
  sentences:
  - ' You won''t be using my SQL. It probably lists Oracle because that''s the ERP
    system the company uses, and it''d be good for the FP&amp;A guy to be familiar
    with the system. Be an expert in Excel, you will probably be using it the majority
    of your workday.'
  - ' "How can someone use the account number to withdraw money without my   consent?
    They can use your account number to game your banks phone support and try to phish
    their way into your account. Banks have gotten very good at combating this, but
    theoretically with just the address he lives in, your name, and a bad bank phone
    rep, he could get into your business. The account number would just be one more
    piece of information to lead with. I have 1 savings and 3 checking accounts with
    the same bank. Would they be able to gain access to the other accounts? Dependent
    on how incompetent the bad bank rep I referenced above is, sure. But the odds
    are incredibly low, and if anything were to happen, the bank would be falling
    over itself to fix it and make reparations so that you don''t sue for a whole
    crap ton more. Is there a more secure and still free option that I have overlooked?
    Opening up yet another checking account solely for accounts receivable and transfer
    to accounts payable would keep your financial records more transparent. Also,
    banks are doing ""money transfer by email"" now, so I don''t know how great that
    is for business transactions, but in that instance you''re just giving out an
    email linked to a money receiving account instead of an actual account number.
    Paypal is also a pretty good EFT middleman, but their business practices have
    become shady in the past 5 years."'
  - ' "Ditto mhoran_psprep.  I''m not quite sure what you''re asking. Where does the
    money come from? When someone starts a bank, they normally get together a bunch
    of investors -- perhaps people they know personally, perhaps they sell stock --
    to raise initial capital. But most of the money in the bank comes from depositors.
    Fundamentally, what a bank does is take money from depositors and loan it to borrowers.
    (Banks also borrow money from other banks and from the government.) They charge
    the borrowers interest on the loan, and they pay depositors interest on their
    deposits. The difference between those two interest rates is where the bank gets
    their profit. Where does the money go when you pay it back? As mhoran_psprep said,
    some of it goes to pay interest to the depositors; some of it goes to pay the
    bank''s expenses like employee salaries, cost of the building, etc; and some of
    it goes as profit to the owners or stockholders of the bank. If you''re thinking,
    ""Wow, I''m paying back a whole lot more than I borrowed"", well, yes. But remember
    you''re borrowing that money for 20 or 30 years. The bank isn''t making very much
    money on the loan each year that you have it -- these days something like 4 or
    5% in the U.S., I don''t know what the going rates are in other countries."'

Specifically, IFF all your credit cards are paid, and you made sure you've got no outstanding liabilities (that also accrues interest), stock indexes might be a good place for 5-10 years timeframes. For grad school, I'd probably look into cash ISA (or local equivalent thereof) -the rate of return is going to be lower, but having it in a separate account at least makes it mentally ""out of sight - out of mind"", so you can make sure the money's there WHEN you need it."</code>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | <code>1</code> |

When the company   buys the shares for you, you do not   owe any taxes. You are exercising your   rights under the ESPP. You have bought   some stock. So far so good. When you sell the stock, the discount   that you received when you bought the   stock is generally considered   additional compensation to you, so you   have to pay taxes on it as regular   income. Source: Turbotax.   Second source. Your pretax rate of return would be: 17% (100/85) In your scenario where the stock price is fixed at $100. Your tax rate would be your marginal rate.   If the stock stayed at 100, you would still be taxed as income on $15/share (the discount) and would receive no benefit for holding the stock one year. Assuming you are in the 25% tax bracket, your after tax rate of return would be 13% ((15*.75)+85)/85)</code> | <code>1</code> |
