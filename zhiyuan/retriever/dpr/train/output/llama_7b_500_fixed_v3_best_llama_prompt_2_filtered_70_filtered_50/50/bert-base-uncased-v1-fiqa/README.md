- source_sentence: What are the differences between a 'grammar Nazi' and a 'grammar
    Nazi'
  sentences:
  - ' If English is your second language or not, it is still incumbent on you to be
    clear. Especially when you are making a strong, specific technical point.  As
    Adorno said, “what is vaguely put is poorly thought.”  And the quality of your
    comment is not improved by carping about whether I’m a “grammar Nazi” or not.  That
    said, autocorrect can get even the best of us.'
  - ' Typically, the discount is taxable at sale time But what about taxes?  When
    the company   buys the shares for you, you do not   owe any taxes. You are exercising
    your   rights under the ESPP. You have bought   some stock. So far so good. When
    you sell the stock, the discount   that you received when you bought the   stock
    is generally considered   additional compensation to you, so you   have to pay
    taxes on it as regular   income. Source: Turbotax.   Second source. Your pretax
    rate of return would be: 17% (100/85) In your scenario where the stock price is
    fixed at $100. Your tax rate would be your marginal rate.   If the stock stayed
    at 100, you would still be taxed as income on $15/share (the discount) and would
    receive no benefit for holding the stock one year. Assuming you are in the 25%
    tax bracket, your after tax rate of return would be 13% ((15*.75)+85)/85)'
  - ' Are there any other losses that can be expected beyond the above? The lender
    may have to invest some money into the house in order to get it in shape to sell.
    Also, while the lender possesses the house they are liable to the property taxes
    and possibly utilities. are there any statutes or pressures to motivate the financial
    institution to get fair price when the property is sold? The lender is motivated
    to at least break even when selling the property in order to limit losses on their
    investment. This means they are very motivated to seek a higher price, but they''re
    also motivated to sell the property quickly in order to limit their losses due
    to property taxes. Usually the lender takes a loss of the investment if foreclosure
    occurs; only 10 percent to 20 percent  of auctioned foreclosed houses did yield
    a surplus. When the lender sells the foreclosed property using a realtor, they''re
    motivated to sell it as quickly as possible so long as they break even. In this
    case there is little motivation to sell the property for a surplus. If the property
    is being sold via auction, then time is not a factor and the lender will just
    sell to the highest bidder.'
- source_sentence: Ideal investments for a recent college grad with very high risk
    tolerance?
  sentences:
  - ' "You file taxes as usual. W2 is a form given to you, you don''t need to fill
    it. Similarly, 1099. Both report moneys paid to you by your employers. W2 is for
    actual employer (the one where you''re on the payroll), 1099 is for contractors
    (where you invoice the entity you provide services to and get paid per contract).
    You need to look at form 1040 and its instructions as to how exactly to fill it.
    That would be the annual tax return. It has various schedules (A, B, C, D, E,
    F, H, etc) which you should familiarize yourself with, and various additional
    forms that you attach to it. If you''re self employed, you''re expected  to make
    quarterly estimate payments, but if you''re a salaried employee you can instruct
    your employer to withhold the amounts you expect to owe for taxes from your salary,
    instead. If you''re using a tax preparation software (like TurboTax or TaxAct),
    it will ""interview"" you to get all the needed information and provide you with
    the forms filled accordingly. Alternatively you can pay someone to prepare the
    tax return for you."'
  - ' Theoretically there is limited demand for risky investments, so higher-risk
    asset classes should outperform lower-risk asset classes over sufficiently long
    time periods. In practice, I believe this is true, but it could be several decades
    before a risky portfolio starts to outperform a more conservative one. Stocks
    are considered more risky than most assets. Small-cap stocks and emerging market
    stocks are particularly high-risk. I would consider low-fee ETFs in these areas,
    like VB or VWO. If you want to seek out the absolute riskiest investments, you
    could pick individual stocks of companies in dire financial situations, as Bank
    of America was a couple years ago. Most importantly, if you don''t expect to need
    the money soon, I would maximize your contribution to tax-advantaged accounts
    since they will grow exponentially faster than taxable accounts. Over 50 years,
    a 401(k) or IRA will generally grow at least 50% more than a taxable account,
    maybe more depending on the tax-efficiency of your investments. Try to contribute
    the maximum ($17,500 for most people in 2014) if you can. If you can save more
    than that, I''d suggest contributing a Roth 401k rather than a traditional 401(k)
    - since Roth contributions are post-tax, the effective contribution limit is higher.
    Also contribute to a Roth IRA (up to $5,500 in 2014), using a backdoor Roth if
    necessary.'
  - ' "With these income levels you cannot deduct any IRA contribution. I.e.: you
    cannot save pre-tax, as you want. But you still can contribute to IRA (as a non-deductible
    contribution), and using the ""loophole"" transfer the contribution to Roth (you
    are probably over the limit to be able to contribute to Roth directly). For pre-tax
    contributions - max out your 401k."'
- source_sentence: How much money do you need to live in Phoenix
  sentences:
  - ' "Gnucash is much more designed for accounting than for budgeting. While it does
    have some simple budgeting features, they''re largely based around tracking how
    much has been spent in the Expense categories/accounts, and seeing how close one
    is to a limit that''s been set. Because the point of Gnucash is accounting, there''s
    not a way to track an expense in two expense categories simultaneously. (You can
    split a transaction across multiple categories, to have a grocery store purchase
    of $150 be split across $100 Food and $50 Phone Minutes or whatever. But not have
    a $150 purchase be tracked as $150 Food and $150 Household expenses, because that''s
    not how double-entry accounting works.) The closest way to do what I think you''re
    looking for is to take advantage of the hierarchical account structure, and repeat
    subcategories as needed. For example: This would allow you to see Household expenses
    vs. Vacation expenses, and still see what it got spent on. Reporting on all ""Food""
    purchases, if you want to do so, is slightly more tricky as you''d need to select
    all those ""Food"" categories separately in your report, but it''s possible. You
    speak about wanting to ""track"" expenses multiple ways, so I think that this
    would allow you to record data sufficient to ""track"" it. But the point of tracking
    any data is to be able to report on it in some fashion, so if you have more specific
    reporting requirements, you might want to ask about that as well."'
  - ' The point of insurance is to trade high variable costs for much lower fixed
    costs. The question isn''t whether you can afford what would be a catastrophic
    event for anyone else, but whether it would be better to pay a small amount regularly
    vs. a possibly larger amount occasionally. One of the reasons to buy insurance
    is to avoid costly litigation (rich people are more frequently targeted for litigation).
    By purchasing liability insurance, the insurance company pays for the litigation
    and/or settlement. If you are wealthy enough to keep an experienced litigation
    firm on retainer, you may not need that benefit, but it might be worth giving
    that stress to a third party. Life insurance is also an important part of estate
    planning because of the tax treatment of insurance payouts compared to the tax
    treatment of a large estate. There are certainly classes of insurance that make
    less sense for those with great cash flow, but money doesn''t obviate all the
    benefits of insurance.'
  - ' In Phoenix you can get a two bedroom for $600/mo in an okay neighborhood if
    you know where/when to look, and a bit cheaper if you''re willing to go a bit
    skeezier. Since we are talking minimum wage, you should be hopefully be able to
    find a job within biking distance (or, if you live in Tempe, take the free bus.)
    Have one person work mornings and the other work evenings/nights and you don''t
    need daycare. (Other options: have them stay with a nearby family member, trade
    off watching the kids with other working families, or go for a three bedroom,
    grab a family member, and have someone work a 20-hr week instead.) Electricity
    averages to something like $100/mo over the course of the year (my high was about
    $150, low was around $40 in a two-bedroom.) So ~$700/mo for shelter, maybe $30/mo
    for a bus pass. That''s $730/mo. I''m not saying it would be comfortable, but
    it can be done.'
- source_sentence: Is the food at In n Out really that bad
  sentences:
  - ' "Systemic and well know patterns in sales are priced in to the security.  Typically
    companies with very cyclical earnings like this will issue guidance of earnings
    per share within a range.  These expected earnings are priced in before the earnings
    are actually booked.  If a company meets these expectations the stock will likely
    stay relatively flat.  If the company misses this expectation, the stock, generally,
    will get slammed.   This kind of Wall Street behavior typically mystifies media
    outlets when a company''s stock declines after reporting a record high level of
    whatever metric.  The record high is irrelevant if it misses the expectation.
    There is no crystal ball but if something is both well known and expected it''s
    already been ""priced in.""  If the well known expected event doesn''t occur,
    maybe it''s a new normal."'
  - ' Meh.  In n Out is cheap, and I know it has pop culture appeal, but their actual
    food is mediocre at best.  They don''t even offer anything unique except very
    basic burgers with almost no toppings, limp fries, and artificial milkshakes.'
  - ' Disclaimer: I am not a tax specialist You probably need a sales tax permit if
    you''re going to sell goods, since just about every state taxes goods, though
    some states have exemptions for various types of goods.  For services, it gets
    tricker. There is a database here that lists what services are taxed in what states;
    in Wyoming, for example, cellphone services and diaper services are taxed, while
    insurance services and barber services are not.  For selling over the internet,
    it gets even dicier. There''s a guide on nolo.com that claims to be comprehensive;
    it states that the default rule of thumb is that if you have a physical presence
    in a state, such as a warehouse or a retail shop or an office, you must collect
    tax on sales in that state. Given your situation, you probably only need to collect
    sales tax on customers in Wyoming. Probably.  In any event, I''d advice having
    a chat with an accountant in Wyoming who can help walk you through what permits
    may or may not be needed.'
- source_sentence: Why do people buy insurance even if they have the means to overcome
    the loss?
  sentences:
  - ' If you have been putting savings away for the longer term and have some extra
    funds which you would like to take some extra risk on - then I say work yourself
    out a strategy/plan, get yourself educated and go for it. If it is individual
    shares you are interested then work out if you prefer to use fundamental analysis,
    technical analysis or some of both. You can use fundamental analysis to help determine
    which shares to buy, and then use technical analysis to help determine when to
    get into and out of a position. You say you are prepared to lose $10,000 in order
    to try to get higher returns. I don''t know what percentage this $10,000 is of
    the capital you intend to use in this kind of investments/trading, but lets assume
    it is 10% - so your total starting capital would be $100,000. The idea now would
    be to learn about money management, position sizing and risk management. There
    are plenty of good books on these subjects. If you set a maximum loss for each
    position you open of 1% of your capital - i.e $1,000, then you would have to get
    10 straight losses in a row to get to your 10% total loss. You do this by setting
    stop losses on your positions. I''ll use an example to explain: Say you are looking
    at a stock priced at $20 and you get a signal to buy it at that price. You now
    need to determine a stop price which if the stock goes down to, you can say well
    I may have been wrong on this occasion, the stock price has gone against me so
    I need to get out now (I put automatic stop loss conditional orders with my broker).
    You may determine the stop price based on previous support levels, using a percentage
    of your buy price or another indicator or method. I tend to use the percentage
    of buy price - lets say you use 10% - so your stop price would be at $18 (10%
    below your buy price of $20). So now you can work out your position size (the
    number of shares to buy). Your maximum loss on the position is $2 per share or
    10% of your position in this stock, but it should also be only 1% of your total
    capital - being 1% of $100,000 = $1,000. You simply divide $1,000 by $2 to get
    500 shares to buy.  You then do this with the rest of your positions - with a
    $100,000 starting capital using a 1% maximum loss per position and a stop loss
    of 10% you will end up with a maximum of 10 positions. If you use a larger maximum
    loss per position your position sizes would increase and you would have less positions
    to open (I would not go higher than 2% maximum loss per position). If you use
    a larger stop loss percentage then your position sizes would decrease and you
    would have more positions to open. The larger the stop loss the longer you will
    potentially be in a position and the smaller the stop loss generally the less
    time you will be in a position. Also as your total capital increases so will your
    1% of total capital, just as it would decrease if your total capital decreases.
    Using this method you can aim for higher risk/ higher return investments and reduce
    and manage your risk to a desired level. One other thing to consider, don''t let
    tax determine when you sell an investment. If you are keeping a stock just so
    you will pay less tax if kept for over 12 months - then you are in real danger
    of increasing your risk considerably. I would rather pay 50% tax on a 30% return
    than 25% tax on a 15% return.'
  - ' Your basic point is correct; the savvy move is to use insurance only to cover
    losses that would be painful or catastrophic for you. Otherwise, self-insure.
    In the specific example of car insurance, you may be missing that it doesn''t
    only cover replacement of the car, it also covers liability, which is a hundreds-of-thousands-of-dollars
    risk. The liability coverage may well be legally required; it may also be required
    as a base layer if you want to get a separate umbrella policy up to millions in
    liability. So you have to be very rich before this insurance stops making sense.
    In the US at least you can certainly buy car insurance that doesn''t cover loss
    of the car, or that has a high deductible. And in fact, if you can afford to self-insure
    up to a high deductible, on average as you say that should be a good idea. Same
    is true of most kinds of insurance, a high deductible is best as long as you can
    afford it, unless you know you''ll probably file a claim. (Health insurance in
    particular is weird in many ways, and one is that you often can estimate whether
    you''ll have claims.) On our auto policy, the liability and uninsured motorist
    coverage is about 60% of the cost while damage to the car coverage is 40%. I''m
    sure this varies a lot depending on the value of your cars and how much you drive
    and driving record, etc. On an aging car the coverage for the car itself should
    get cheaper and cheaper since the car is worth less, while liability coverage
    would not necessarily get cheaper.'
  - ' "Other individuals answered how owning an REIT compares to an individual real
    estate investment, but did not answer your second question as readily, ""are REITs
    a good option to generate passive income for awhile?"". The ""awhile"" part is
    quite important in answering this question. If your intentions are to invest for
    a relatively short time period (say, 7 years or less), it may be especially advantageous
    to invest in a REIT. The foremost advantage comes from significantly lower transaction
    fees (stock/ETF trades are practically/potentially free today) compared to purchasing
    real estate, which involves inspection+titling fees/taxes/broker fees, which in
    a round-trip transaction (purchase and sale) would come to ~10%. The secondary
    advantage to owning a REIT is they are much more liquid than a property. If you
    wanted to sell your investment at a given point in time, you can easily log into
    your brokerage and execute your transaction, while liquidating an investment property
    will take time on market/potentially tossing tenants/fixing up place, etc. On
    the other hand, illiquid investments have generally yielded higher historical
    returns according to past research."'

  | <code>What's a reliable way for a non-permanent resident alien in the USA to get an auto loan?</code> | <code> I don't think that they ask you for your citizenship status when you apply in a dealership. At least I don't remember being asked. I know of at least 3 people from my closest circle of friends who are in various immigration statuses (including one on F1) and got an auto loan from a dealership without a problem and with good rates. They have to ask for your immigration status on online applications because of the post-9/11 law changes. Edit to allow Dilip to retract his unjustified downvote: Chase and Wells Fargo have a reliable track of extending auto loans to non-permanent residents.</code>                                                                                                                                                                                 | <code>1</code> |
  | <code>When a stock price goes down, does the money just disappears into thin air?</code>              | <code> Yes and no. There is no actual money involved - just assumed value. Imagine you own a picture that you painted yourself, and all your friends agree it is worth 1000 $. You feel like you have a 1000 $-picture. Now a guy with some more knowledge visits you, and tells you that it is really only worth about a 100 $. Did you just lose 900 $? If yes, where did the money go?</code>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | <code>1</code> |
  | <code>Getting (historical) Standard & Poor Stock Guides</code>                                        | <code> I haven't seen one of these in quite some time. Back in the 1970s, maybe the 1980s, stock brokers would occasionally send their retail clients a complimentary copy once in a while. Also, I remember the local newspaper would offer a year-end edition for a few dollars (maybe $3) and that edition would include the newspaper company's name on the cover. They were very handy little guides measuring 5 1/2 x 8 (horizontal) with one line devoted to each company. They listed hundreds of publicly traded companies and had basic info on each company. As you stated, for further info you needed to go to the library and follow-up with the big S&P and/or Moody's manuals. That was long before the internet made such info available at the click of a button on a home computer!</code> | <code>1</code> |
