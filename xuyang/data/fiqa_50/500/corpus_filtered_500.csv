419996,,"To take a higher level view of this, consider the warranty as buying insurance.  They want to sell you the warranty because there's profit in it for them over the aggregate of all the warranties they sell. So ask yourself, would having to replace this item out of your own pocket cause you a significant financial burden?  Items like houses we insure because we can't afford to lose the investment.  Items like cars we get liability insurance because we can't afford to pay for another person's medical costs if we're liable for their injury.   On the other hand, if you're talking about a $1000 piece of equipment in your house, this won't break you.  That means you can self-insure, and if you do that for all the items you purchase, over the long haul, then you will save money (equal to the profit that the company expects on the warranties). So I say, no, don't buy extended warranties.  The more they're trying to sell it to you, the less you should be willing to buy it (because the higher their profit margin is if they can convince you to buy it).",{}

People commuting from out of the area, businesses re-inventing themselves to be more efficient to hold profits, less skilled workers moving to lower cost of living areas like Renton to find work.

While it does have some simple budgeting features, they're largely based around tracking how much has been spent in the Expense categories/accounts, and seeing how close one is to a limit that's been set. Because the point of Gnucash is accounting, there's not a way to track an expense in two expense categories simultaneously. (You can split a transaction across multiple categories, to have a grocery store purchase of $150 be split across $100 Food and $50 Phone Minutes or whatever. But not have a $150 purchase be tracked as $150 Food and $150 Household expenses, because that's not how double-entry accounting works.) The closest way to do what I think you're looking for is to take advantage of the hierarchical account structure, and repeat subcategories as needed. For example: This would allow you to see Household expenses vs. Vacation expenses, and still see what it got spent on. Reporting on all """"Food"""" purchases, if you want to do so, is slightly more tricky as you'd need to select all those """"Food"""" categories separately in your report, but it's possible.

Because the gift card is not associated with any person, no verification is needed to add that address, you can give them any address you want.  Also I believe that the card numbers in use for gift cards are specific, that is you could tell that a card is a gift card based on the number alone. That means it is likely possible for a merchant to reject those gift cards while still accepting other cards from that network.  This is likely for certain transactions. For example,  a hotel or car rental agency requires a credit card for incidentals, and it's likely that the system itself will outright reject a gift card even if it has enough on it for the initial hold.

I've been shopping at Whole Foods for (almost) 30 years, and the reason is because Whole Foods has put its research into discovering what and how to serve me, and then delivering. The experience of shopping in a Safeway, Albertson's or the like is ugly, uncomfortable, cold and smelly. They are too big and take forever to get from one item I want to another. They are filled with junk they are trying to trick me into thinking is nutritious.  And they've tricked you into thinking they aren't.

Because, despite being pretty much the same thing, they make a lot of noise about not being the same so they can charge you a premium.  I could trace back food in just about any store I go into, why should WF get a cookie for this?  The packages come with labels and even if they don't, the case that held those items did, which means that knowing where your food came from never gets more complicated than asking the staff.  To me, those things ARE deceptive, because they're marketing things that everyone does as though it's a unique selling point.  Even Walmart has farm to table sourcing.  It's in a QR code on their salads.     &gt;I'm *thrilled* that it is. That means I can access food that I want and enjoy, and it costs less than it would otherwise.

There's not a lot of sugar there to start with.   &gt;Do you think commercial food producers and other grocery outlets don't collectively FAR outspend Whole Foods to promote less nutritious food that is as inexpensive as possible to produce? That they don't sacrifice quality for profits?   Not really, I think whole foods has hoodwinked a whole bunch of millennials into believing the hype that just because they have a farmers market decor that somehow they're better and more pure than other stores.  Almost every business in a capitalist economy sacrifices quality for profits.  That's how it works.  I don't like whole foods because they're tricking gullible people like you into thinking that they give a single shit about you or your health.  They don't, they care about the money in your wallet.

Any funds you have in an 100% offset acount reduces the amount of interest you have to pay on the mortgage.  So if your mortgage is $100,000 and you have $10,000 in the offset account then you only pay interest on $90,000 within the mortgage. Also the funds in the offset account are at call any time as it is simply a savings account. You can have all your pay go into it and have direct debits set up for all your bills. This way you will benefit from maximising the amounts in your offset account and reducing the amount of interest you pay on your mortgage. If your current linked savings account is not an 100% offset account ask your bank if you can change it over to one that is. If they don't have offset accounts for that particular mortgage account ask them if they have a different mortgage account with offset accounts.

458455,,"""GreenMatt - this is a good question, and a question I have asked about whether to invest in a Roth IRA, or a traditional IRA. This is my take on the picture, I'm not sure about your tax situation and how much you'd have to pay for each conversion you did, whether you have extra money to pay those taxes, etc. In my opinion I don't think it would be a good idea to use your 401(k) principal to pay taxes, but to have the extra money to pay these when rolling over so you don't lose any interest, especially since you're near the """"end"""" of your """"snowball"""" effect with interest in your retirement account. Here is a resource to consider. Also, another thing to consider that I don't really see much of on here is inflation. If you're going to be in the same tax bracket as you are now, and if whatever you're contributing to your 401(k) or traditional IRA is NOT bumping you down in the 15% bracket, then I would suggest doing a ROTH IRA. I say this because to me, when I retire, I would have rather paid my taxes throughout the years (I'm 23 and in 25% marginal tax bracket) in a ROTH IRA and pay nothing when I'm withdrawing in 30 years, factors people forget to consider are that the Cost of Living is going to be MUCH MUCH higher for me down the road, and the cost of sending a child to school is going to be much higher as well. Since your child is young, consider this site for the cost of a college education for your child. This is comparing the average cost of education for someone attending college in 2015 versus 2033 (a child born IN 2015). While this seems drastic, and there could be a lot of different things that happen by that time, it's a decent illustration. While the website provided certainly isn't validated by the DoE, I have read multiple articles about this, and they are all very similar. Again, other things could happen between now and your child's college career, but if college becomes """"free"""" we're paying for it, and if it's not free and raises at historical rates you're paying for it.

293083,,"Your calculations are good as far as they go, but there are lots of other factors and pros and cons to each decision. Yes, you should certainly compare the monthly rent to what your mortgage payments would be, as you have done. Yes, you should consider how long you might live there. If you do move out, how difficult will it be to sell the house, given market conditions in your area? If you try to rent it, how difficult is it to find a tenant, and what rent could you expect to receive? Speaking of moving out and renting the place: Who will manage the property and do maintenance? Would you still be close enough to do this yourself? Would you be willing and able to spend the time? Or would you have to hire someone? Also, what if the tenant does not pay the rent? How difficult is it to evict someone in your area? Speaking from personal experience, I own a rental property in Ohio, and the law says you can evict someone with 3 days notice. But in practice they don't just leave, so then you have to take them to court. It takes months to get a court date and months longer before the police actually show up to order them out of the house. And you have to pay the lawyer and court fees. In that time they're living in your property rent free. In my case one tenant also totally trashed the place and stole everything that wasn't nailed down -- I had to spend $13,000 on repairs to a house worth a fraction of what you're talking about. Being a landlord is NOT just a matter of sitting back and collecting rent checks: there's a fair amount of work and a lot of risk. What do you have to pay the realtor, and what other closing costs would you have to pay? Where I live, realtors typically charge 6 to 7%. You may also have to pay for an appraisal, title search, and bunch of other little fees. Mortgage interest is deductible on your federal income taxes. Rent is not. If you own and something needs to be repaired, you have to pay for it. If you rent, the landlord has to pay for it.  If you own, you can do pretty much what you like with the property -- subject to zoning ordinances and building codes and maybe homeowners association rules, but you should have a pretty good amount of leeway. If you want to install ceiling fans or remodel the kitchen or add a deck, it's up to you. If you're renting, it's up to the landlord to decide what you can do to the property. And if he agrees to let you do some upgrade, when you're done, it belongs to him. With a condo, you are not usually responsible for exterior maintenance, like mowing the lawn and trimming the bushes and washing the outer walls. With a house, you are. You might pay someone to do this, which adds to the cost, or you might do it yourself, which takes time. Insurance on a condo or aparment is much less than insurance on a house. In my area, anyway. You should investigate those costs. If you buy, eventually you own the place and don't have to pay a mortgage any more. If you rent, you continue to pay forever. (Even if you don't live in the same house forever, as long as you don't take a terrible loss when you sell you should then have some money left over to apply to the next house, so you are still building equity.) Some of these pros and cons are easily quantifiable. Others are probabilities, like how likely is it that your water heater will fail?, and how long is it likely to take to find a buyer if you want to sell? And others are pretty subjective.",{}

For background, see Wikipedia. Experimentation by central banks in the wake of the 2007 financial crisis, however, demonstrates that slightly negative interest rates are possible. First of all, note that the """"zero lower bound"""" on interest rates has everything to do with the existence of cash as an alternative. It's a lower bound on the nominal interest rate, rather than the real interest rate—that is, on the rate before adjusting for inflation. In most situations, the real interest rate is more economically meaningful, as it's the real interest rate that measures the market's preference for """"stuff now"""" as opposed to """"stuff later."""" There's nothing in principle or in practice to stop a negative real interest rate: there are always some people who want stuff now and some people who want stuff later; a negative real interest rate just means that people who want stuff later are more dominant in the market. As I stated earlier, what creates the """"zero lower bound"""" is the existence of cash as an alternative to bonds. Even though that lower bound applies, it's not strict: hoarding cash in large quantities can be difficult and expensive, especially when central banks are doing their best to prevent you from doing it. Consequently, investors who strongly prefer """"stuff later"""" to """"stuff now"""" are willing to pay a slightly negative nominal interest rate on bonds in order to avoid those costs.

552810,,"""So after a great deal of clarification, it appears that your question is how to adjust your withholding such that you'll have neither a refund, or a balance due, when you do your 2016 taxes next year.  First, a little terminology. The more you have withheld, the more money will be taken out of your check to cover your estimated tax liability. Confusingly, the more allowances you select on your W-4, the less money you will have withheld (more allowances means more dependents/deductions/other reasons why you will owe less tax). When you go to file your 2015 tax return next year, you'll figure out exactly how much you owe. If you had too little tax withheld, you'll have to pay the difference. If you had too much tax withheld, you'll get a refund back.  Given your situation, simply following the instructions on the W-4 should work pretty well. If you want to be more precise, you can use the IRS Withholding Calculator to figure the number of allowances and submit a new W-4 to your employer.  It's a little hard to tell whether """"paying this much/year in taxes seem steep?"""" because you've lumped all the taxes together in one big bucket. Does the $543.61 in taxes per paycheck include Social Security (OASDI) and Medicare taxes? Whatever you do, it's not going to be an exact science. Come tax time, you'll figure out exactly what you owe and either pay the balance or get a refund back. As long as you're relatively close, that's fine.

I can offer some insight into how you can think about it.   """"Required rate of return"""" is a fairly arbitrary concept and literally is whatever you define it to be. Typically, the required rate of return is a function of risk i.e. the higher the riskiness of a project, the higher the return must be to compensate you for taking on that risk (this view is as per Markowitz's modern portfolio theory). This is easier said than done however as """"risk"""" is tricky to define (The general, though somewhat outdated, rule is that risk = variability of returns).  To your questions:  1. How is rate of return determined: In my field of work (fairly niche) required rate of returns aren't usually an exact science and are typically based on i) financial leverage in the business ii) operating risk (seasonality, management team strength etc...) iii) type of security (e.g. for debt deals, what is the investment secured by)  2. Am I correct in thinking a firm will just choose a rate of return that they are already receiving? No, you are not correct, UNLESS the risk profile of the investment opportunity matches your current business. E.g. if you're a shoe manufacturer earning 15% on your capital and are looking to acquire another manufacturer in the same business with the same risk profile, then you can use your current rate of return as the requirement. If for e.g. you're a shoe manufacturer contemplating opening a new fully automated plant which will cost half your current net worth but allow you to triple your production, you will need to use a different (higher) required rate of return to compensate your firm for the additional risk it's taking on.

457276,,"""Your math is correct. If you take the same amount of pre-tax wages (assuming that that amount can be fully contributed in both Traditional and Roth cases), and assuming the same flat tax rate when contributing and withdrawing, then the two are the same. However, we don't have a flat tax, and due to the way our tax brackets work, there is often a slight advantage to Traditional accounts. Recall that not every dollar of your income is taxed at the same rate; the tax bracket only describes the rate that the last dollar of your income is taxed at. But some of your income will be taxed at lower brackets. No matter what your income is, your first $x of income will be taxed at 10%, then $y at 15%, etc. So what is the tax rate of the dollars of income that you used to contribute to a retirement account? Is it the first dollars of income? The last dollars of income? or what? Since we are comparing an after-tax contribution (Roth) versus a pre-tax contribution (Traditional) whose income doesn't show up in taxable income, and all other income is equal, the dollars contributed is considered to come from the top in the Roth case. Similarly, when you withdraw in the Traditional case, the withdrawal counts as income; is it the first dollar of income or the last dollar of income? Again, since we are comparing the situation where the withdrawal counts as income (Traditional) with the one where it doesn't (Roth), all other income being equal, the taxable income is considered to be added to the top. The difference is that when you contribute to a retirement account, you contribute a very small percentage of your income every year, probably no more than 5-10%. If we count down from the top, this small percentage of your income probably falls wholly within a bracket (in other words, the taxable income in Traditional and Roth cases are likely in the same bracket), so the entire contribution is at the same rate -- your marginal rate, the rate you cite as your tax bracket. However, when you withdraw in retirement, it is likely that every year, the retirement account withdrawals account for a large percentage of your income, maybe even half or more. If we count down from the top, this large percentage of your income probably crosses into lower brackets (in other words, the taxable income in Traditional and Roth cases are likely to be in different brackets), so the withdrawal is partly taxed at one rate, partly taxed at another. So if your tax bracket is 15% in the Traditional case, it's likely that your withdrawal is taxed partly at 15% and partly at 10%. So in this case, the average tax rate on the withdrawal is lower than your """"bracket"""".""",{}

Generally, eating less or no meat [reduces your risk](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/meatless-meals/art-20048193) of coronary heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer.  The """"better for your health"""" link leads to another article which in turn cites [this Harvard page](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/protein/) which in turn cites three observational studies. It might be worth noting that in general these types of studies come to the wrong conclusions about 80% of the time ([Ioannidis, 2005](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16060722/)). The """"reduces your risk"""" link is just a Mayo Clinic article on recommended intakes with no linked studies.  The assumption here is that eating less meat will improve health because the *correlation* seen in these observational studies and e.g cancer, diabetes, heart disease, etc.  But what does studies in vegetarians tell us? If just reducing meat consumption has a ~20% reduction in relative risk then not eating meat at all should have an greater effect. But we don't see that, studies show no effect on overall mortality in non-SDA vegetarians:  [Figure 2 mortality](http://imgur.com/WgSrBJa)  *Kwok CS, et. al,* [""""Vegetarian diet, Seventh Day Adventists and risk of cardiovascular mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis""""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25149402) *Int J Cardiol. 2014 Oct 20;176(3):680-6. doi: 10.1016/j.ijcard.2014.07.080. Epub 2014 Aug 4.*  What these observational studies in the general population show is other factors, e.g the healthy adhere bias where people who eat less meat tend to be healthier, and not that meat is inherently unhealthy.  &gt; While Google is focused on improving employee health, serving less meat is also part of its initiative to reduce its carbon footprint. Significantly more water and other resources are required to raise and slaughter animals than to grow fruits, vegetables, legumes, and grains. According to a study published in the journal [Climatic Change](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-014-1169-1), a plant-based diet has a significantly lighter carbon footprint than a meat-heavy diet.  These diets also reduce overall protein consumption, when you compared equal protein intakes, factor digestibility, and amino acid content, the differences in emissions are trivial ([longer post](https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/4qs4eg/meat_is_horrible_it_may_be_delicious_but_the/d4wd70e/)). Water use isn't that different either ([short post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/comments/558vdq/trailer_before_the_flood_2016_documentary_movie/d89jxdy/))  Looking at the big picture shows that meat shouldn't be the focus. In the US *all* agriculture, including crops grown for human consumption, is just 8.1% of emissions:  *In 2012, emission sources accounted for in the Agricultural chapters were responsible for 8.1 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.*  *Environmental Protection Agency*, [""""Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Agriculture""""](http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/Downloads/ghgemissions/US-GHG-Inventory-2014-Chapter-6-Agriculture.pdf).

507596,,"""Going by the information from Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the Australian Government website, there seem to be a number of possibilities. Note: First I am neither a tax expert nor a lawyer; this is simply my interpretation of the rules on the page linked above. Second, this interpretation is based on the assumption that """"resells a service"""" means you (at least technically) buy the service from another company and sell it on to the users of your app. Depending on the nature of the service, and possibly factors such as whether you are deemed to """"take possession"""" during the transaction, it might be that different rules apply. Your Turnover is Under A$75,000 (Providing you're not reselling taxi services!) You won't need to register for GST, should not charge it, and your invoices should show that GST was not included in the price. However, if the turnover of the company whose services you are reselling is registered for GST, they will be charging you GST that you will not be able to claim back, so you would need to factor this into the price you charge your users (before any promotional discount). For example: Your Turnover is Over A$75,000 If your turnover is above the limit, you would need to charge GST on the final sale amount and pay this amount (one eleventh of the price your customer paid) to the Australian Government. You also have to send out properly-formatted tax invoices. However, it's probably safe to say the company you are buying the original service from will also be over the GST threshold, so you should be able to reclaim the GST that was charged to you by them.  For example: Here, your overall profit/loss is helped by the fact that you can reclaim the GST you were charged, and can under some circumstances result in an overall rebate. These figures assume you add 10% to your selling price to cover the GST you have to pay the Government. However, this may make your offering uncompetitive, so you may have to absorb some/all of the GST yourself.""",{}

160464,,"""You have a large number of possible choices to make, and a lot of it does depend upon what interests you when you are older. The first thing to note is the difference between ISAs and pension-contribution schemes tax wise, which is of course the taxation point. When you contribute to your pensions scheme, it is done before taxation, which is why when you draw from your pension scheme you have to pay income tax. Conversely, your ISA is something you contribute to after you have already paid income tax - so besides the 10% tax on dividends if you hold any assets which may them, it is tax free when you draw on it regardless of how much you have accrued over the years.  Now, when it comes to the question """"what is the best way to save"""", the answer is almost certainly going to be filling your pension to the point where you're going to retire just on the edge of the limit, and then putting the rest into ISAs. This way you will not be paying the higher rates of tax associated with breaking the lifetime limit, but also get maximum contributions into your various schemes. There is an exception to this of course, which is the return on investment. If you do not have access to a SIPP (Self Invested Personal Pension), you may be able to receive a far higher return on investment when using a Stocks & Shares ISA, in which case the fact that you have to pay taxes prior to funding it may not make a significant difference. The other issue you have, as others have mentioned is rent.  While now you may be enjoying London, it is in my opinion quite likely that will change when you get older, London has a very high-cost of living, even compared to the home counties, and many of its benefits are not relevant to someone who is retired. When you retire, it is quite possible that you will see it fit to take a large sum out of your various savings, and purchase a house, which means that regardless of how much you are drawing out you will be able to have somewhere to live. Renting is fine when you are working, but when you have a certain amount of (admittedly growing) funds that have to last you indefinitely, who knows if it will last you.""",{}

So in two years, you might be better off if you had invested the money versus paying the loan, or you might be much worse off.  In ten years, your chances of coming out ahead are better, but still not guaranteed. What's confusing is I've heard that if you're investing, you should be investing in both stocks and bonds (since I'm young I wouldn't want to put much in bonds, though). So how would that factor in?  Bonds have lower risk (uncertainty) than stocks, but lower expected returns.  If you invest in both, your overall risk is lower, since sometimes (not always) the gain in stocks are offset by losses in bonds).

I have a few loans still outstanding, but most have prepaid or defaulted by now. I did not reinvest as payments came in. Based on my experience, one """"catch"""" is lack of liquidity. It's like buying individual bonds rather than a mutual fund. Your money is NOT just tied up for the 3-year loan term, because to get good returns you have to keep reinvesting as people pay off their loans. So you always have some just-reinvested money with the full 3 year term left, and that's how long it would take to get all your money back out. You can't just cash out when you feel like it. They have a trading platform (which I did not try out) if you want your money sooner, but I would guess the spreads are wide and you have to take a hit when you sell loans. Again though I did not try the trading platform. On the upside, the yields did seem fine. I got 19 eventual defaults from 81 loans, but many of the borrowers made a number of payments before defaulting so only part of the money was lost. The lower credit ratings default more often obviously, only one of 19 defaults had the top credit score. (I tried investing across a range of credit ratings.) The interest rates appear to cover the risk of default, at least on average. You can of course have varying luck.  I made only a slight profit over the 3 years, but I did not reinvest after the first couple months, and it was during a recession. So the claimed yields look plausible to me if you reinvest. They do get people's credit scores, report nonpayment on people's credit reports, and even send people to collections. Seems like borrowers have a reason to pay the bill. In 2008 I think this was a difference compared to the other peer lending sites, but I don't know if that's still true. Anyway, for what it's worth the site seemed to work fine and """"as advertised"""" for me.

They buy office buildings, fund new companies, buy up stocks, and drive investment in general. Someone has to do these things. Office buildings can't just be owned by """"the people"""". Someone with a ton of money has to come along and fund them.   For example, one of my friends knows Elon Musk (founder of Pay-Pal, Tesla Motors, Solar City, and Space X).

They invest their money, they don't just horde it away in a savings account. The things people like Musk do create jobs and sometimes entire industries (or three entire industries in his case).

Indeed innovation is what creates more productivity, which is fueled by debt, but debt is fueled by real savings, which comes from under consuming, which is easier when your productivity is higher. The government can stimulate innovation yes, but only at the expense of someone else.   What's really scary is the federal reserve has been manufacturing all the savings for nearly a decade now. So there's a complete mismatch between credit and savings, and the overall economy. The actual price of money itself is manufactured too, so just about all asset prices are inherently flawed in my view.   I think it's important to piggy back your point about innovation and how productivity can't really go down, because inventions and new methods of producing goods don't disappear(once we come up with the combustible engine or a new drug for example, it's now here forever ideally, it's work that we don't have to do all over again).  What brings on a crash or feeling like we're going backwards in terms of progress comes when we somehow manage to go through a boom bust (like in 2008), but then take on all this debt, normally we can pay off debt but when the government manufactures it, and credit is created out of nothing, that's when you get into problems like not being able to pay it back - because it wasn't truly real or representative of real savings.

Let's analyze this:  &gt;virtually ever item in the CPI is adjusted using hedonics  How does one apply hedonics to energy? There are so many items in the CPI basket for which this does not even make sense I don't know where to begin with such a blanket statement. [Here is how the BLS computes CPI](http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpifaq.htm#Question_6). Note the categories, and that they currently track hundreds of goods in each of about 200 categories, totaling tens of thousands of goods. With a little digging you can find the weighting. [Here is the list of what they apply hedonic weights to](http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpihqaitem.htm). It is a vastly smaller subset of all goods tracked, and the weightings makes them not affect overall CPI much *at all*. All the precise methodologies are listed on the BLS site, and you can track it all down. As stated below, someone has done the analysis (and there is a PDF on the site) and they obtained that incuding hedonic items affects inflation only by 0.005 percent per year.   &gt;which by definition can only be used to lower inflation  By your definition? The actual definition does not force either direction. In reality it adjusts up and down as clearly shown in BLS reports, which I'll link below.   &gt;, not adjust it up.  As I'll list below, it in fact does go both ways.  Finally, analysis of hedonics seems to indicate it has a miniscule effect on inflation rates, again papers are cited in the link shown below.  [Critics often incorrectly assume that BLS only adjusts for quality increases, not for decreases, and that hedonic adjustments have a large downward impact on the CPI. On the contrary, BLS has used hedonic models in the CPI shelter and apparel components for roughly two decades, and on average hedonic adjustments usually increase the rate of change of those indexes. Since 1998, hedonic models have been introduced in several other components, mostly consumer durables such as personal computers and televisions, but these newer areas have a combined weight of only about one percent in the CPI. A recent article by BLS economists estimated that the hedonic models currently used in the CPI outside of the shelter and apparel areas have increased the annual rate of change of the All Items CPI, but by only about 0.005 percent per year.](http://www.bls.gov/cpi/cpiqa.htm#Question_4).  &gt;inflation represents how the value of the dollar has accrued vs the value of a 20"""" TV, which is what the definition of inflation is.  No, inflation must measure the price *of the same good* over time. When some goods are no longer available, other goods must be investigated to provide continuity in the comparisons. Otherwise you'll have me comparing the price of a horse to the price of a car since they both provide transportation, yet over time one replaces the other, and direct comparisons on $ alone does not accurately measure what one gets for their money.  You cannot compare the cost of different goods purely on price alone and call that inflation.  &gt;So, no, I don't think you're correct on this.  Well, [since other places that track inflation](http://bpp.mit.edu/) arrive at very similar results using different methodologies, and a vastly larger pool of goods I think that you overstate that the changes did not increase accuracy of inflation measurement.  &gt;This is also kind of glossing over the fact that the CPI essentially makes the bold argument that energy and transportation prices never affect inflation.  CPI makes no such claim. What do you think caused inflation in the early 1970s when oil prices shot up? [Here is the most recent CPI data release from BLS](http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm) which quite clearly shows both energy and transportation changes being reflected in the CPI.

You will quickly learn how to compute precisely how much of each payment goes to interest and how much goes to principal given different payment choices. Would it be wiser to spend more each month on loan payments? That depends on your goals and resources, which we know nothing about. If you have extra money you could spend it on debt reduction, or you could spend it on an investment that pays more money in growth or dividends than the interest you'd save. Or you could decide that the longer you have that loan, sure, the more interest you'll pay, but inflation will make future money less valuable. Basically, by taking out a loan you have chosen to gamble that the thing you bought with the loaned money will be worth the cost of the interest payments in the future, adjusted for inflation. The bank on the other hand is gambling that you're good for the debt and that they can make a reasonable profit off it. If you have more money to gamble with, which bet is the wisest one is really up to you. would it be smarter to try to pay off one loan before the other? If you want to pay off a loan early then always choose the loan with the higher interest rate. should I start making bi-weekly payments instead of monthly? That's roughly equivalent to paying off the principal by one additional payment a year. There are two reasons to do so.  The first is that the total interest will be lower and the loan will be paid off faster. You can work out exactly how much with your new found skill at amortization computation.   The second is the simple convenience of knowing that your budget for each pay period is the same.  That convenience is worth something; is it worth the amount extra you'll be paying every year? Again, this is for you to decide. Work out how much extra you're paying per year and how much you're saving in the long run, and compare that against the benefit.""",{}

358769,,"&gt; Okay, why?  Because the only modern justification for the existence of a nation is the social contract.   &gt; We have seen that corporations will push limits regularly which shows little respect for the law or other people's property.  Without the concept of corporate person-hood, a impartial judicial system to settle disagreements, and enforcement significantly more powerful than all actors, corporations would have little reason to heed claims of property.  Ownership would become a question of what you can control, not what you made/traded for.   Exactly. That's why we have the social contract and thus services like police and civil courts that ensure the mutual respect for each other's property.  But for the vast majority of interactions enforcement won't be required since you want your property respected as well. It's the golden rule  &gt; Tell me why.  Because - once again - mandatory public healthcare is based on forced redistribution of wealth, which is a violation of the social contract.

Unless a   company decides to issue more shares, the supply of shares of an   individual stock trading in the marketplace is finite. When demand   increases for shares of an ETF, however, Authorized Participants (APs)   have the ability to create additional shares on demand. Through an """"in kind"""" transfer mechanism, APs create ETF units in the   primary market by delivering a basket of securities to the fund equal   to the current holdings of the ETF. In return, they receive a large   block of ETF shares (typically 50,000), which are then available for   trading in the secondary market. This ETF creation and redemption   process helps keep ETF supply and demand in continual balance and   provides a """"hidden"""" layer of liquidity not evident by looking at   trading volumes alone. This process also works in reverse. If an investor wants to sell a   large block of shares of an ETF, even if there seems to be limited   liquidity in the secondary market, APs can readily redeem a block of   ETF shares by gathering enough shares of the ETF to form a creation   unit and then exchanging the creation unit for the underlying   securities. Thus, the in-kind swap to the underlying securities is only done by APs so the outflow would be these individuals taking a large block of the ETF and swapping it for the underlying securities.

118184,,"So why are people still buying 15 year old Saturns or driving the same GM Denali for the last 13 years when the new cars are so much more efficient and cheaper to run?  Poor people are fucking poor.  Now you turn to Indonesia. How much do you think they are spending to maintain their vehicles? Next to nothing, that's what. They'll only fix it enough to get it running again. SAE certified mechanic? LOL, the guy between the whore house and the cigarette vendor can also do it.  How much do you think electricity costs in the Philippines? It can cost $100 USD a month to run the AC at night to get a decent sleep...The average Filipino makes less than $10 a month.",{}

98736,,"""&gt;Please explain who is being held down in this situation. An employment agreement is voluntary. Wages are set by supply and demand.  Please study the history of the labor movement in the United States. There's a reason we're paid actual money and not """"company bucks."""" Because businesses WILL find a way to pay employees nothing if they can.   &gt; So you want to violently intervene and kill off the livelihoods of people because they voluntarily work for a business you deem too unprofitable to exist?  No. I want to ensure that the price paid for labor matches its real cost. Again, study the labor movement.  &gt;The jobs will be replaced by machines and the people whose jobs you killed now live 100% on the dole, likely forever. Most of the people affected will be minorities. I can't imagine a more heinous and racist act of economic violence.  Sounds like the same fucking thing people (racists) said during the labor movement.  &gt; Individuals who would rather see perfectly able bodied people 100% on the dole rather than providing for themselves should be ashamed. Seriously, fuck you and fuck your violent and racist policies.  People who don't study history are doomed to repeat it. Seriously, fuck you and your complete and total ignorance of history and complete lack of understanding about basic economic theory.""",{}

Might be some fuel cell use (hydrogen) but generally electric is the way to go.  Enhanced battery tech investment needed badly.  Range is critical and removable and replaceable batteries the way to go too.  Pull into a garage and have your spent battery pack removed and replaced by a fully-charged pack.  Pay $3 and go on your way.  It's the way of the future.",{}
262597,,"The issue is should you get one large policy or several smaller policies. Multiple polices have flexibility becasue if the need goes away you can drop the policy. The problem with multiple small policies is that there is overhead that you pay for multiple times. Assume that you want 100K coverage and are age x. That policy will cost you a certain amount based on a base amount plus a percentage of the coverage. The percentage is based on age, sex, smoking, health. If you double the coverage the price doesn't double becasue the base amount is constant. This base amount covers the cost of setting up your policy and maintaining the records and billing.  Keep in mind that the coverage you are asking about is not the mortgage insurance the lender makes you purchase when you have a small down payment. You are asking about a policy to cover your debts and still provide money for survivors. Go with your current agent company and ask them to run the numbers: new additional policy, increasing amount of current policy. Go with what meets your needs. Buying a house is one of those life events where you should review your insurance and retirement needs, and adjust accordingly.",{}
355268,,"I agree but the reality is that despite laws on the books, no matter how egregious corporate behavior in the US is, rarely do the courts impose any real punishment.  It's always a small fine by the courts or the government which only encourages the bad behavior.  Its always pennies on the dollar of what they got and no jail time for anyone.  Business know this.  Heard of Blue Bell ice cream? They knew there was a problem with their ice cream, instructed employees to cover it up and continues to sell ice cream which killed people.  The state of Texas gave them a fine sure to have everyone repeat this and the company will delay for decades any settlement with the families.   It's the American way.  You have no power over corporations.",{}

In terms of deal structure start with your financial model  and evaluate  your payback period and IRR...

Generally the investor will want to get 100% of their original investment paid back plus a annual  8%  """"preferred"""", return and after they are made whole 80% of proceeds, but I've seen restaurant deals at 50/50 splits and no preferred return.
