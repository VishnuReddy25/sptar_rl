Maybe we need stronger legislation, maybe we don\'t, but it doesn\'t change today\'s answer.

I don\'t have any data on the relative numbers of who is being notified/notifying between merchants and payment processors, but at the point when your card is identified as compromised there\'s no reason to suppose that an individual merchant in the traditional sense has been compromised, let alone identified. In fact because there\'s a fast moving investigation it could even be a false alarm that led to your card getting cancelled. Conversely it could be a hugely complex multinational investigation which would be jeopardised. It\'s simply not safe to assume that simply ""brand X"" has been compromised, therefore everything ""brand X"" knows about you is also compromised: Furthermore there\'s no reason to assume the merchant has even admitted to, or discovered the root cause.

If you are generically trying to increase your wealth by bearing risk, you can get a better risk/reward ratio in a fully diversified portfolio including stocks and bonds as well and REITs.  ""Passive income"" means making money by bearing risk.  REITs alone, without diversifying into other financial assets, do a poor job of generating income for the amount of risk you bear. So why are REITs not very comparable to buying a house and renting it out?  Because in the latter case you are being paid not only for bearing the risk of the house depreciating but also you are being compensated for the work you do as a landlord.  Moreover, because the house doesn\'t trade in a liquid market like REITs do, it is possible to actually get a good deal, as opposed to the fair deal you will get on a REIT. TL;DR: The ""passive income"" generated by REIT investment is more similar to generic equity/bond investment than it is to an investment in a physical home that you rent out.
